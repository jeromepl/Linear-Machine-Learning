# Linear-Machine-Learning

Short project to learn the basics of machine learning.
Working in collaboration with Elie Harfouche (https://github.com/Kartoshka)

This is an attempt to identify as accurately as possible the digits on the images in the MNIST database.
It uses linear regression with gradient descent to achieve this.
